**Checking for NULL Values in SQL**
====================================

In SQL, `NULL` represents the absence of a value. You can use the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators to filter data based on the presence or absence of values in a column.

**Examples**
-----------

###1. Find customers with a null phone number

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM customers 
WHERE phone IS NULL;
```

* This query returns all rows from the `customers` table where the `phone` column has no value (i.e., is `NULL`).

###2. Find customers with a non-null phone number

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM customers 
WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;
```

* This query returns all rows from the `customers` table where the `phone` column has a value (i.e., is not `NULL`).

**Key Points**
-------------

* Use `IS NULL` to find rows where a column has no value.
* Use `IS NOT NULL` to find rows where a column has a value.
* Avoid using `= NULL` or `!= NULL`, as these expressions are not valid in SQL.

**Why `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL`?**
------------------------------------

In SQL, `NULL` is not equal to anything, including itself. Therefore, you cannot use the `=` or `!=` operators to check for `NULL` values. Instead, use the `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` operators, which are specifically designed for this purpose.

**Best Practices**
-----------------

* Use `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` to filter data based on the presence or absence of values in a column.
* Be aware that `NULL` values can affect the results of aggregate functions, such as `SUM` and `COUNT`.
* Consider using `COALESCE` or `IFNULL` functions to replace `NULL` values with default values, if needed.
